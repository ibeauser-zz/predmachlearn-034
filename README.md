# predmachlearn-034

## Project requirements and assessment
### Required:
Predict the manner (the "classe" variable) in which six participants in a study performed barbell lifts using any of the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of the participants. Create a report describing the model build, the use of cross validation, the expected out of sample error rate, what choices were made in the analysis, and why those choices were made. Twenty test cases are to be predicted by the model created.

### Assessed:
1. Has the student submitted a github repo?
    + 10: Yes, and the repo contains BOTH .md or .Rmd files AND a compiled HTML file
    + 00: No, they have not submitted a repo.
2. Does the submission build a machine learning algorithm to predict activity quality from activity monitors?
    + 5: Yes, and they appropriately describe how the algorithm is built
    + 3: Yes, but the model building process is not described
    + 0: No, the submission does not describe how the model was built.
3. Do the authors describe what they expect the out of sample error to be and estimate the error appropriately with cross-validation?
    + 5: Yes, the authors estimate the out of sample error with cross validation
    + 3: Yes, the authors estimate the out of sample error but do not use cross validation
    + 0: No, the authors do not estimate out of sample error.
